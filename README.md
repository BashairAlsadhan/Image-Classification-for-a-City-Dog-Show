# Image-Classification-for-a-City-Dog-Show
Project Goal: Improving your programming skills using Python.
In this project, I used a created image classifier to identify dog breeds, which allowed me to focus on Python and not on the actual classifier.
# Description:
My city is hosting a citywide dog show, and you have volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration. Every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based on the biographical information.
Some people are planning on registering pets that arenâ€™t actual dogs. I need to use an already-developed Python classifier to make sure the participants are dogs.

# Objectives:
1- Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if the breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.  
2- Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.  
3- Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieves objectives 1 and 2.  
4- Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms takes to run.
